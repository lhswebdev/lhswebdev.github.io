                        Hey there! I'm one of your co-presidents, and I've been coding for about five years. I have experience with some cool technologies like Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, and other really cool stacks (not related to WebDev). I hope to be able to teach you guys some advanced web development tools, and how to create advanced projects with persistent, real-time data.

                        Hi there! I'm the other co-president, and have been learning coding since 5th grade, starting with web dev.  I have much experience with the standard languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript, and with many of JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as Vue, JQuery, and Angular. I have built websites for multiple volunteering organizations, for hackathons, and for myself and friends. If you join Web Dev, you'll learn the skills to do the same! We'll be working on cool projects throughout the year and possibly do some competitions, so make sure you and your friends join!

                        Hello! I'm your Vice President for 2018/19. I primarily work with JVM languages but also have experience with functional programming, real-time control systems, and server-side web development. This summer, I built a robotics software framework, researched type-systems, and programmed microcontrollers. Currently, I'm managing web development for two organizations. WebDev this year is going to be great. We make all sorts of cool and interesting projects - donâ€™t miss out!

                        Hello World!
                        I'm the lead developer for the 2019-2020 school year.
                        I'll be working with both front-end and back-end development.
                        I have many years of experience with languages such as JavaScript, 
                        Python, C++, and more!
                        Recently, I've been working on many machine learning projects
                        with libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow.
                        I'm a very strong believer in the future of Web 2.0, and I'm 
                        also a huge open source enthusiast.
                        I'm really excited to be a part of the Web-Dev team!

                        Hey! I'm Sofia, your 2019/20 secretary/treasurer. Having only coded for about a year, I definitely have much left to learn on my journey through computer science. I initially realized my interest for web development just last year, which later persuaded me to begin studying CS myself. So don't worry if you don't have any experience! Passion stems from interest, and we'd be happy to help you find yours.
